        Compare the following two sentences and determine if they have the same meaning. Answer with "true" if they do and "false" if they do not. No Explanation needed, do not repeat question.

        Example1:
        <example1>
        Sentence 1: The sky is blue.
        Sentence 2: The sky is clear.
        Answer: false
        </example1>

        Example2:
        <example2>
        Sentence 1: She is a doctor.
        Sentence 2: She practices medicine.
        Answer: true
        </example2>

        Now, compare these sentences:

        <class>
        Sentence 1: [{i[0]}]
        Sentence 2: [{i[1]}]
        
        Do the two sentences have the same meaning? Answer with "true" if they do and "false" if they do not
